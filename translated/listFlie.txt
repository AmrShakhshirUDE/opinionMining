   yea I dont want ya as James Bond
   We all love Ryan but hes Canadian and instead of killing the baddie he would try to talk them down by being nice
   You woud make a great James Bond but you would have to change the Gin for Martini
HE LOOKS LIKE AN AGENT OR KINGSMAN TYPE OF SHIT IN 2ND GO JAMES BOND GO JAMES BOND GO GO GO GO
   I agree with Ryan Reynolds I like the tradition of having English actors play Bond And a truly controversial actor is someone like Idris Alba Its time

James Bond No Time to Die is without a doubt the most stunning
I really ordered the entire JamesBond collection on bluray cause I wanted the NoTimeToDie steelbook

 My favorite James Bond movie also Great to know I am in excellent company And
I dont know what Id do with James Bond I dont know if it makes total sense to reboot entirely We just did it and I dont know if enough changed since Casino Royale for it to be worth seeing his whole life cycle again  Heres what I might try if I was in charge
Cant keep track

New James Bond movie  it was announced to be released in April 2020 but it ultimately released on theatre on 30th Sep 2021 Almost 15 years of delay on a movie release

would never allow that. He would cut off Ryan's arms and legs just to avoid him playing Bond
Wonderful Brings back memories of a tour with James Bond
James Bond No Time to Die is without a doubt the most breathtaking
I actually ordered the entire JamesBond collection on Bluray because I wanted the NoTimeToDie steelbook
It's right Hard no. It's owned by the British BUT it would be phenomenal to see a person of color in the role that I'm looking at you in

fine
Id prefer it when it's a diversion that goes on its first mission and dies instantly and we get the real 007 who is Nyongo
My favorite James Bond film too. Good to know I'm in excellent company
I don't know what I'm doing with James Bond. I don't know if it makes absolute sense to start over from scratch. We just did, and I don't know if enough has changed since Casino Royale to make it worth revisiting its entire lifecycle. Here's what I could try if I were in charge
Can't keep track
AND AND AND

We see this in the many adaptations of Ian Fleming's James Bond. No one can say that Daniel Craig's Bond fundamentally takes Sean Connery's character

dudson Well, in that case maybe he should have said JC was worse. The point is, it was a tough question, but if he'd answered a few easier ones, maybe no one would notice he fended that off. He wouldn't even respond to that
The new James Bond film was announced to be released in April 2020, but it was eventually released theatrically on September 30, 2021. Almost 15 years delay in a film release

It's not great enough when you compare it to the original anime, but when you consider CowboyBebop's live-action on Netflix on its own, it's a very enjoyable space western show that feels like James Bond -Movies in the era of Roger Moore's and Quentin Tarantino's film mixed on the site

BOB ODENKIRK FOR JAMES BOND PASS IT ON
Why not
wb Well then Ryan can be her buddy
Oh yes
dr No, then sure
A Canadian accent is acceptable
He's my pick for a soft reboot and there were Bond references on the film's website
A CANADIAN Bond What a brilliant insight if not a traditional Bond

This line would work if you don't turn off the Bondspoiler alert at the end of the movie. Let me think about how to finish the next James Bond film. I know plastic surgery always works when you're out of ideas
But I was expecting you
How about a Canadian version of Bond where he says OO like oo in moo and none of the bad guys can kill him because he's too nice
The only fair way to do this is to toss all the potential actors' names in the box
already has too many franchises. All well deserved
It looks just like the Next 007 says right now
Well, that's a hard no. The Rock wasn't supposed to be Bond
Danny DeVito for Bond

Sir you are too massive you could play a Bond vehicle faster than James Bond himself
While I worship Ryan
Kind of a BondAustin Powers hybrid
I think it should be an unknown actor. A search must begin
It won't be the same if he adds a yes to the end of everything
James Bond is more real than the actors who played him
You have ruined your own essence
You just nominated yourself, mister
I mean
Yes yes yes Ryan you're a pro Let's hear you say, shaken not moved, in your best British accent
